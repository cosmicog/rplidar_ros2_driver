/**
 * @file lidar_driver_wrapper.hpp
 * @brief Abstract interface and concrete implementations for Slamtec RPLIDAR
 * drivers.
 *
 * This header defines a common abstraction layer for Slamtec RPLIDAR devices.
 * The goal is to decouple the vendor-specific Slamtec SDK from higher-level
 * application or ROS 2 node logic.
 *
 * It provides:
 *  - An abstract @ref LidarDriverInterface that describes the required driver
 * API
 *  - A real implementation @ref RealLidarDriver that wraps the Slamtec SDK
 *  - A lightweight @ref DummyLidarDriver used for simulation, testing, or CI
 *
 * By depending only on this interface, the rest of the system can be tested
 * without hardware and can evolve independently from the vendor SDK.
